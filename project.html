<h4>Adopting Solar Energy</h4>

<div class="text_type1">Knowing where solar energy can be utilized is crucial. Solar energy is a renewable resource, capable of providing a constant source of power for the future. It also helps to lower greenhouse gas emissions and can decrease energy costs for households and businesses. By identifying where solar energy can thrive, we can work towards a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future.
    The utilisation of solar energy and other renewables is vital for the longevity of life on Earth, but for their implementation to be successful, income and development inequality has to decrease. This page will highlight which countries' solar-adoption would benefit most and why implementation world-wide is not yet possible.

<h5>IRRADIANCE</h5>
<container class="separator2">



<div class="text_type1">Contrary to popular assumption and as the <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EElmiI9IQgwYcl_lQCt-9XtCooX2akuI?authuser=1" style="color:#89ffe0">clusters depict</a>, equatorial nations are not always those with the most solar energy potential. In reality, data indicates that deserts farther from the equator, where there is high irradiance and low precipitation, are the optimum places for solar energy systems. The figures below illustrate this, suggesting that regions 2000-4000Km away from the equator with low precipitation tend to have higher irradiance.</div>

<h5>EMISSIONS</h5>
<container class="separator2">

    <div class="text_type1">A primary advantage of solar energy is its reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Countries with high electricity consumption typically release more GHGs, as the scatterplot shows. These nations can reduce their emissions and reliance on fossil fuels by switching to solar power.</div>
    <div class="text_type1">(This data is replicable as API automation allows for analysation over time)</div>

        </div>

<h5>CONSUMPTION</h5>
<container class="separator2">

    <div class="text_type1">To determine the optimal countries for the switch, I regressed electricity consumption on average temperature which revealed a negative relationship. However, when average temperature is above 25ËšC, electricity consumption is more spread as developed countries with high temperatures, like Qatar/Kuwait, use more energy for ventilation, while the less-developed majority cannot afford to. This indicates that switching to solar favours countries at temperature extremes.</div>

        </div>

<h5>DEVELOPMENT</h5>
<container class="separator2">

    <div class="text_type1">As explained, solar adoption depends on a country's development and affordability of initial costs. Developed countries have seen increases in solar capacity and decreases in costs, while less-developed countries like Vietnam are experiencing initial cost increases. </div>

        </div>


        <div class="text_type1">The correlation from the <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A_NVGqrK_5d9N6ZhQCIyZDVInJbYql4P?authuser=1" style="color:#89ffe0">regression</a> between percentage of solar energy generation and solar energy costs is negative, with higher costs resulting in less usage. However, low costs do not yet result in higher usage due to less-developed countries' limited monetary ability to switch to solar.</div>

<h5>CONCLUSION:</h5>
<h5>OPTIMAL COUNTRIES</h5>
<container class="separator2">
    <div class="text_type1">By gathering all the information presented, the best country to adopt solar energy is one that has a desert, is within 2000-4000km of the equator, has high energy consumption and high GHG emissions, and is well developed. Following these criteria, countries like China, the USA and Australia are obvious candidates with their large deserts, developed economies and high consumption and emission industries. However, if we recall that below 2000km away from the equator there were countries with very high irradiance, we reach our honeypot site: the Persian Gulf. Countries like the UAE, Qatar and Kuwait boast large deserts, strong economies and immense amounts of emissions due to their >94% fossil fuel dependency.
        Further work in these countries is necessary to allow for a legislative implementation of this adoption, for a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly planet. Fortunately, this study is highly replicable, with access to all data sources, manipulations and visualizations, making it conveniently reconstructable for other renewable energy sources.

<h5>CHALLENGES:</h5>
<container class="separator2">
    <div class="text_type1">In my data cleaning and analysis process, I encountered a number of challenges. One issue I faced was that Vega-lite had difficulty reading my raw Github CSV data, I circumvented this by inputting the values manually. Additionally, I had to scrape data from a PDF and used PyPDF2 to do so. This required splitting the page into cells by " " and manipulating the dataframe to resemble the table I wanted.
        To batch-download emissions data that updates whenever the API updates, I used for-loops and the "requests" library. In order to complete machine learning visualizations, I had to create NumPy matrices by creating a list of lists for the X-axis and a list for the y-axis. I used K-Means for clustering and Linear Regressions from the scipy and sklearn libraries.
        I also encountered challenges when reading large files, as pandas was initially unable to. I bypassed this by reading the files in chunks and concatenating them, and creating masks to filter the data I needed. I also faced issues with data downloaded in wide format, utilizing the .melt() function to unpivot them into long format to allow for graph-making. Finally, a few of my regressions returned low R-squared values, which required me to change some of my project's underlying assumptions; initially, I had tried to prove that countries on the equator would be the best to adopt solar energy, but I reformulated my argument when faced with the facts of the data.</div>
