        <h1>FIRST 1</h1>
        <p>Photovoltaic systems absorb solar energy (irradiance). Ergo the more irradiance the better their output.
           One would think that countries around the equator have the most irradiance since they have the highest temperature however this is false as illustrated here:
        </p>
        <h2>Although solar panels absorb energy from the sun, hotter temperatures actually make them less efficient.</h2>

        <h1>FIRST 2</h1>
        <p>The areas in the chloropleth above are seen here to have low percipitation and so can be identified as deserts, meaning higher output of PV systems comes from those placed in deserts as opposed to those by the equator</p>
        <div class="chart1" id="chloro2"></div>


        <h1>FIRST 3</h1>
        <p>Upon the disproval that countries close to the equator have higher irradiances, this clustering algorithm groups 3 sets of countries on their choice of solar energy adoption:</p>
        <p>Closest to equator: Higher spread of irradiance - Ideal to for some, not all</p>
        <p>2000-4000Kms from equator: Smaller spread of higher irradiance - Ideal for all</p>
        <p>Furthest from equator: Smaller spread of lower irradiance - Ideal for none</p>

        <h1>SECOND</h1>
        <p>One of the main benefits of switching to Solar is to reduce GHG emissions.
            Using the graph below, we can see that adoption of solar energy from high emission countries has not occurred but that it has paid off for those who have adopted it like Australia and Chile
            Notably, Argentina has a 25% energy generation from all renewables, hence its low emissions, but South Africa as one of the highest GHG emittors is simply found to have low methane emissions as opposed to all other greenhouse gases

        <h1>THIRD</h1>
        <p>Countries that consume more energy emit more pollution and so would benefit more from the switch to solar.
            In this regression, warmer countries are shown to consume less electricity up until their average temperature exceeds ~23Â°C where the developed ones can consume more on ventilation and the less-developed majority cannot.
            This means that countries on the extremes of temperature would benefit the most from the switch as they can consume environmentally-cleaner energy.
