        <h3>Particulate matter 2.5 levels in the air in a 15-day period</h3>
        <p>The term fine particles, or particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are two and one half microns or less in width.
        Like inches, meters and miles, a micron is a unit of measurement for distance.
        There are about 25,000 microns in an inch.</p>
