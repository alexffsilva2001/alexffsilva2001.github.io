        <p>The term fine particles, or particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are two and one half microns or less in width.
        Like inches, meters and miles, a micron is a unit of measurement for distance.
        There are about 25,000 microns in an inch.</p>

        <p>Chart 2 shows google "news searches" for Bitcoin and Inflation. You can see that searches spike relatively close to eachother in time. This infers that investors are taking bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and the spikes in searches are due to due diligence as opposed to hive speculation.</p>
